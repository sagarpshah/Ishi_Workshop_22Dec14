This demo uses parse.com as a remote DB and EasyStore (https://github.com/sagarpshah/EasyStore) library.
It's using CocoaPods as well. Run "pod install" command after check-out.

1) Save parsed holidays in local DB.
2) Whenever app is launched, it should be displayed from local DB and then get updated from server.
