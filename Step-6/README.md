This demo uses parse.com as a remote DB and EasyStore (https://github.com/sagarpshah/EasyStore) library.
It's using CocoaPods as well. Run "pod install" command after check-out.

1) In step-6, we made sure that same object won't get inserted again in DB, instead updated.
2) Take care of deleted object from server.
